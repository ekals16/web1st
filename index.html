<h1>HTML</h1>
<p>
<strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong> or <u>HTML</u> is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (<u>CSS</u>)</strong> and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
